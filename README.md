# JS Playground

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/xk0der/jsplayground.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/xk0der/jsplayground)

A repository of JS Scripts to test out JavaScript features.

I'm using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), but with some changes, the scripts can be run within browsers as well.
Some of the features may be pretty new, so make sure to use latest Node.js build (or browsers).

To play around, clone and run following first

    npm install
    
Then following to execute code
    
    npm run play
    
To run tests

    npm test
