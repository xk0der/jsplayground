# jsplayground

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/xk0der/jsplayground.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/xk0der/jsplayground)

A repository of JS Scripts to test our JavaScript features.

I'm using NodeJS for testing these scripts. With some changes, can be run inside browsers as well.
Some of the features being used a are pretty new, so make sure to use latst NodeJS (or browsers).

To play around, clone and run following first

    npm install
    
Then following to execute code
    
    npm run play
    
To run tests

    npm test
